### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I help make open source tools be useful for research and education, and help these communities apply open source technology to do their work. I work with a bunch of open-source communities and projects, most-notably in the [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) ecosystem. I'm also the [Director of 2i2c](https://2i2c.org), a non-profit dedicated to interactive computing in research and education.
